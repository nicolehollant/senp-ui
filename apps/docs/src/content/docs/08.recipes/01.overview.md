# Overview

Stuff thats not in the main module :)

---

There's some stuff we (I) didn't include in the main module, this section has some examples of things we (I) didn't deem worthy of being a _core_ component but might be something you would want! These will have some basic implementations and instructions for how to set them up yourself, think of it as a more "shadcn-ui" approach for extensions.
